    <h2 id="biography" class="inside_written_part">⭕ BIOGRAPHY</h2>
    <p class="innerOfIWP">Linus Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator and principal developer od the Linux kernel, which is the kernal for a number of operating systems. He also created the version control system Git.
        Torvalds was born on December 28,1969 in Helsinki,Finland. He studied computer science at the university of Helsinki, and he developed the Linux kernel as a student project in 1991.
        <br>
✅ <b>Early Life and Education:</b> <br>
    --- Linus Torvalds grew up in Helsinki, Finland. His interest in computers developed at an early age, and he began programming as a hobby. Torvalds attended the University of Helsinki, where he studied computer science.
<br>
✅ <b>Creation of Linux:</b> <br>
-- In 1991, while a student at the University of Helsinki, Linus Torvalds began working on a new operating system kernel. He initially named it "Freax," a combination of "free," "freak," and the "x" representing Unix. However, a friend hosting the project's files on a server named it "Linux," a portmanteau of Linus and Unix, without Torvalds' initial knowledge. The name stuck, and Linux became the official name of the operating system.
<br>
✅ <b>Open Source Collaboration:</b> <br>
-- Linus Torvalds adopted an open-source development model for Linux, allowing developers worldwide to contribute to its codebase. This collaborative approach contributed to the rapid growth and success of Linux. The General Public License (GPL) was chosen to license the Linux kernel, ensuring that it remains open and free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.
<br>
✅ <b>Personal and Professional Life:</b> <br>
-- Torvalds moved to the United States in the early 1990s and has held positions at various technology companies. Notably, he worked at Transmeta Corporation and later joined the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL). OSDL eventually merged with the Free Standards Group to form the Linux Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports the development of Linux and open-source software.
<br>
✅ <b>Contributions and Recognition:</b> <br>
-- Linus Torvalds is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the open-source software community. His contributions to the development of the Linux kernel have earned him numerous awards and honors. He received the Millennium Technology Prize in 2012, among other accolades.
<br>
✅ <b>Management of the Linux Kernel:</b> <br>
-- Torvalds remains the principal developer of the Linux kernel and oversees its development process. He uses the Git version control system for managing the source code, and he continues to play a crucial role in the decision-making processes of the Linux kernel development community.
